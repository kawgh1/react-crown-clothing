    - #### Javascript Objects We Get Back From Firestore
        - A **query** is a request we make to Firestore to give us something from the **Database**
            - **Firestore returns us two types of objects: references and snapshots**
                - Of these objects, they can be either **Document** or **Collection** versions
                - Firestore will **always** return us these objects, even if nothing exists at/from that query
        - **QueryReference**
        - **QuerySnapshot**
